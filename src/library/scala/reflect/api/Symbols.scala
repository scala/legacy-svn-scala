     *  Access level encoding: there are three scala flags (PRIVATE, PROTECTED,
     *  and LOCAL) which combine with value privateWithin (the "foo" in private[foo])
     *  to define from where an entity can be accessed.  The meanings are as follows:
     *
     *  PRIVATE     access restricted to class only.
     *  PROTECTED   access restricted to class and subclasses only.
     *  LOCAL       can only be set in conjunction with PRIVATE or PROTECTED.
     *              Further restricts access to the same object instance.
     *
     *  In addition, privateWithin can be used to set a visibility barrier.
     *  When set, everything contained in the named enclosing package or class
     *  has access.  It is incompatible with PRIVATE or LOCAL, but is additive
     *  with PROTECTED (i.e. if either the flags or privateWithin allow access,
     *  then it is allowed.)
     *
     *  The java access levels translate as follows:
     *
     *  java private:     hasFlag(PRIVATE)                && !hasAccessBoundary
     *  java package:     !hasFlag(PRIVATE | PROTECTED)   && (privateWithin == enclosing package)
     *  java protected:   hasFlag(PROTECTED)              && (privateWithin == enclosing package)
     *  java public:      !hasFlag(PRIVATE | PROTECTED)   && !hasAccessBoundary
