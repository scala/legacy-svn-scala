/** A template trait for sequences of type `Seq[A]`
 *  $seqInfo
 *
 *  @define seqInfo
 *  Sequences are special cases of iterable collections of class `Iterable`.
 *  Unlike iterables, sequences always have a defined order of elements.
 *  Sequences provide a method `apply` for indexing. Indices range from `0` up the the `length` of
 *  a sequence. Sequences support a number to find occurrences of elements or subsequences, including
 *  `segmentLength`, `prefixLength`, `indexWhere`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexWhere`, `lastIndexOf`,
 *  `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `indexOfSlice`.
 *
 *  Another way to see a sequence is as a `PartialFunction` from `Int` values
 *  to the element type of the sequence. The `isDefinedAt` method of a sequence
 *  returns `true` for the interval from `0` until `length`.
 *
 *  Sequences can be accessed in reverse order of their elements, using methods
 *  `reverse` and `reverseIterator`.
 *
 *  Sequences have two principal subtraits, `IndexedSeq` and `LinearSeq`, which give different guarantees for performance.
 *  An `IndexedSeq` provides fast random-access of elements and a fast `length` operation.
 *  A `LinearSeq` provides fast access only to the first element via `head`, but also
 *  has a fast `tail` operation. 
 *
 *  @tparam A    the element type of the collection
 *  @tparam Repr the type of the actual collection containing the elements.
