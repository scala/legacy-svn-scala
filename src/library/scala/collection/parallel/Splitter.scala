   *  
   *  This overloaded version of the `split` method is specific to precise parallel iterators.
   *  It returns a sequence of parallel iterators, each iterating some subset of the
   *  elements in this iterator. The sizes of the subiterators in the partition is equal to
   *  the size in the corresponding argument, as long as there are enough elements in this
   *  iterator to split it that way.
   *  
   *  If there aren't enough elements, a zero element iterator is appended for each additional argument.
   *  If there are additional elements, an additional iterator is appended at the end to compensate.
   *  
   *  For example, say we have a parallel iterator `ps` with 100 elements. Invoking:
   *  {{{
   *    ps.split(50, 25, 25, 10, 5)
   *  }}}
   *  will return a sequence of five iterators, last two views being empty. On the other hand, calling:
   *  {{{
   *    ps.split(50, 40)
   *  }}}
   *  will return a sequence of three iterators, last of them containing ten elements.
   *  
   *  '''Note:''' this method actually invalidates the current iterator.
   *  
   *  Unlike the case with `split` found in parallel iterable iterators, views returned by this method can be empty.
   *  
   *  @param sizes   the sizes used to split this split iterator into iterators that traverse disjunct subsets
   *  @return        a sequence of disjunct subsequence iterators of this parallel iterator
