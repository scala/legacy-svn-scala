/** A template trait for iterable collections of type `Iterable[A]`.
 *  $iterableInfo
 *  @define iterableInfo
 *    This is a base trait for all $mutability Scala collections that define an `iterator`
 *    method to step through one-by-one the collection's elements.
 *    Implementations of this trait need to provide a concrete method with
 *    signature:
 *    {{{
 *       def iterator: Iterator[A]
 *    }}}
 *    They also need to provide a method `newBuilder`
 *    which creates a builder for collections of the same kind.
 *
 *    This trait implements `Iterable`'s `foreach`
 *    method by stepping through all elements using `iterator`.
 *    Subclasses should re-implement `foreach` with something more efficient,
 *    if possible.

 *    This trait adds methods `iterator`, `sameElements`,
 *    `takeRight`, `dropRight` to the methods inherited
 *    from trait <a href="../Traversable.html" target="ContentFrame">
 *    `Traversable`</a>.

 *    Note: This trait replaces every method that uses `break` in
 *    `TraversableLike` by an iterator version.
 *
 *  @author Martin Odersky
 *  @version 2.8
 *  @since   2.8
 *  @tparam A    the element type of the collection
 *  @tparam Repr the type of the actual collection containing the elements.
 *
 *  @define Coll Iterable
 *  @define coll iterable collection
 *  @define zipthatinfo the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is 
 *    the same class as the current collection class `Repr`, but this
 *    depends on the element type `(A1, B)` being admissible for that class,
 *    which means that an implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, (A1, B), That]`.
 *    is found.
 *  @define zipbfinfo  an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the
 *    result class `That` from the current representation type `Repr`
 *    and the new element type `(A1, B)`.
