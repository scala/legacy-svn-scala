/** A template trait for traversable collections of type `Traversable[A]`.
 *  $traversableInfo
 *  @define mutability
 *  @define traversableInfo
 *  This is a base trait of all kinds of $mutability Scala collections. It
 *  implements the behavior common to all collections, in terms of a method
 *  `foreach` with signature:
 * {{{
 *     def foreach[U](f: Elem => U): Unit
 * }}}
 *  Collection classes mixing in this trait provide a concrete 
 *  `foreach` method which traverses all the
 *  elements contained in the collection, applying a given function to each.
 *  They also need to provide a method `newBuilder`
 *  which creates a builder for collections of the same kind.
 *  
 *  A traversable class might or might not have two properties: strictness
 *  and orderedness. Neither is represented as a type.
 *  
 *  The instances of a strict collection class have all their elements
 *  computed before they can be used as values. By contrast, instances of
 *  a non-strict collection class may defer computation of some of their
 *  elements until after the instance is available as a value.
 *  A typical example of a non-strict collection class is a
 *  <a href="../immutable/Stream.html" target="ContentFrame">
 *  `scala.collection.immutable.Stream`</a>.
 *  A more general class of examples are `TraversableViews`.
 *  
 *  If a collection is an instance of an ordered collection class, traversing
 *  its elements with `foreach` will always visit elements in the
 *  same order, even for different runs of the program. If the class is not
 *  ordered, `foreach` can visit elements in different orders for
 *  different runs (but it will keep the same order in the same run).'
 * 
 *  A typical example of a collection class which is not ordered is a
 *  `HashMap` of objects. The traversal order for hash maps will
 *  depend on the hash codes of its elements, and these hash codes might
 *  differ from one run to the next. By contrast, a `LinkedHashMap`
 *  is ordered because it's `foreach` method visits elements in the
 *  order they were inserted into the `HashMap`.
 *
 *  @author Martin Odersky
 *  @version 2.8
 *  @since   2.8
 *  @tparam A    the element type of the collection
 *  @tparam Repr the type of the actual collection containing the elements.
 *
 *  @define Coll Traversable
 *  @define coll traversable collection
 *  @define thatinfo the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is 
 *    the same class as the current collection class `Repr`, but this
 *    depends on the element type `B` being admissible for that class,
 *    which means that an implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]`
 *    is found.
 *  @define bfinfo an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines
 *    the result class `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and
 *    and the new element type `B`. 
 *  @define orderDependent
 * 
 *    Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying collection type is ordered.
 *  @define orderDependentFold
 * 
 *    Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying collection type is ordered.
